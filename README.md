# Particle Swarm Optimization Web Application with Ray

## Introduction

The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a powerful approximation algorithm designed to find optimal solutions for a variety of mathematical problems. This project introduces a web application that implements the PSO algorithm with interactive features. Leveraging the capabilities of Ray for distributed computing, this application provides users with a scalable solution to tackle optimization challenges.

## Motivation

In the era of artificial intelligence, the development of models based on neural networks and machine learning algorithms is prevalent. Swarm Intelligence (S.I.) draws inspiration from collective behaviors observed in nature, such as bird flocks and ant colonies, to address complex problems. The PSO algorithm, inspired by flocking birds, employs a group of particles that communicate to collectively achieve optimal solutions. This project aims to showcase the power of swarm intelligence in solving real-world optimization problems.

The integration of Ray into the project addresses the increasing complexity of interactive AI applications. Ray, a distributed computing framework, offers solutions to challenges related to high processing demands and adaptability. With a unified interface for task-parallel computation, Ray ensures enhanced performance and scalability.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a distributed web application that provides users with a customizable platform for utilizing the PSO algorithm. Users can visualize swarm intelligence and apply it to solve optimization problems tailored to their needs. The emphasis is on making the framework accessible to a wide range of users, leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of Ray for efficiency.

## Literature Survey

The PSO algorithm, initially proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, finds its roots in the study of bird flocking and fish school behavior. This implementation utilizes Python, Bokeh for plotting, and Panel for dashboarding to enhance the visualization of the PSO algorithm.

The integration of Ray into the project is motivated by the challenges faced by domain scientists, as discussed in [6]. Ray provides a solution for designing Python-based applications that take advantage of parallelism and distributed computing. By distributing tasks among workers, Ray optimizes the performance of computationally intensive algorithms.

## Design

The system design comprises three main components: the implementation of the PSO algorithm, the use of Bokeh and Panel libraries for dashboard development, and the integration of the dashboard with the Ray framework for distributed computing. This client/server approach ensures a seamless and interactive experience for multiple users on a public network.

The PSO algorithm, Bokeh, Panel, and Ray are seamlessly integrated to create a distributed web application. This design allows for asynchronous code execution, effectively parallelizing the algorithm across worker nodes.
